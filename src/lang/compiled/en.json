Are cycle paths with protective bollards the best solution to reduce the palpable conflict between motor and cycle traffic, or is the width of the cycle path the deciding factor? What effect does the colour of the cycle path have? Which conditions help cyclists to feel their safest when the cycle path is on the pavement or on the road?"

Routes along minor roads and side streets were perceived to be extremely unsafe if the street was not marked as ‘car-free’. Detailed analysis of the different types of cycle paths and their influencing factors, including from the perspective of motorists and pedestrians, will be presented in the statistical evaluation section of this report."

In their assessment, they propose a taxonomy of cyclists/non-cyclists, which they use to describe various preferences road users have for cycle infrastructure. The questionnaire used in their study was extremely thorough; since our focus was rather to collect data on the safety ratings of street scenarios, we therefore reduced the questionnaire down to the most important elements. By changing the questionnaire the results of the two studies are therefore admittedly not directly comparable (see Schwarz, 1999 and Catania et al., 1996), but this was felt to be the right decision in light of the main goal of our survey. Alongside collecting the participant’s sociodemographic data (age, gender, place of residence, number of children), the survey also included questions about their transport behaviour - in particular, whether and to what extent the person travelled by bike."

In this way we were able to measure the influences of different street characteristics and analyse these data, although many other influencing factors were identified which would be required to reach a complete understanding of how various scenarios are perceived in real life.In cooperation with a Berlin-based daily newspaper, we were able to reach a large number of participants. Roughly 90% of the participants were based in Berlin. Additionally, certain demographic groups were overrepresented in the survey: namely men, those in the age group 30 to 64, and cyclists. However, the large total number of participants meant that the amount of data collected for the underrepresented groups was also sufficient.In an initial analysis of the survey, the influence of various factors in relation to each other showed that it was not possible to draw any linear conclusions about subjective safety in cycle infrastructure design. It was nonetheless possible to extract several core conclusions and overall recommendations about how a “cycle infrastructure for everyone” could look."
