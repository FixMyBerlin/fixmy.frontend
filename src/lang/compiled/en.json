Are cycle paths with protective bollards the best solution to reduce the palpable conflict between motor and cycle traffic, or is the width of the cycle path the deciding factor? What effect does the colour of the cycle path have? Which conditions help cyclists to feel their safest when the cycle path is on the pavement or on the road?"

On average, however, cycle paths running along the pavement were felt to be safer than those running next to moving traffic. Routes along minor roads and side streets were perceived to be extremely unsafe if the street was not marked as ‘car-free’. Detailed analysis of the different types of cycle paths and their influencing factors, including from the perspective of motorists and pedestrians, will be presented in the statistical evaluation section of this report."

In their assessment, they propose a taxonomy of cyclists/non-cyclists, which they use to describe various preferences road users have for cycle infrastructure. The questionnaire used in their study was extremely thorough; since our focus was rather to collect data on the safety ratings of street scenarios, we therefore reduced the questionnaire down to the most important elements. By changing the questionnaire the results of the two studies are therefore admittedly not directly comparable (see Schwarz, 1999 and Catania et al., 1996), but this was felt to be the right decision in light of the main goal of our survey. Alongside collecting the participant’s sociodemographic data (age, gender, place of residence, number of children), the survey also included questions about their transport behaviour - in particular, whether and to what extent the person travelled by bike."
