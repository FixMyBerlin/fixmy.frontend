Even less was known about how different street characteristics alter this perception of safety - characteristics such as the design, width and position of a cycle path or the setup either side of said route. Are cycle paths with protective bollards the best solution to reduce the palpable conflict between motor and cycle traffic, or is the width of the cycle path the deciding factor? What effect does the colour of the cycle path have? Which conditions help cyclists to feel their safest when the cycle path is on the pavement or on the road?"

This allowed us to analyse the extent to which individual characteristics - such as cycle path width, path surface, physical barriers, parking on the right side of the cycle path etc - make a difference. We were also able to gain insights into how the perceived sense of safety differs between different groups of road users and from the perspective of both motorists and pedestrians.\n"

Motorists prefer almost exactly the same configuration but without the green colouring. The wide, green-coloured cycle path, separated from the motor traffic by planters, received the most ‘safe’ ratings (83.93%) and ‘mostly safe’ ratings (15.18%). On average, however, cycle paths running along the pavement were felt to be safer than those running next to moving traffic. Routes along minor roads and side streets were perceived to be extremely unsafe if the street was not marked as ‘car-free’. Detailed analysis of the different types of cycle paths and their influencing factors, including from the perspective of motorists and pedestrians, will be presented in the statistical evaluation section of this report."
